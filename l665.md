## Introduction

This is a graduate course that focuses on the introducing of machine learning techniques that are used in Computational Linguistics.

Machine learning problems in CL are rather non-typical for machine learning because natural language includes a significant level of exceptions. The course will provide an overview of the most important machine learning algorithms, but it will mostly focus on how to apply machine learning to CL problems such as co-reference resolution, morphological analysis, parsing, and word sense disambiguation. In addition to the numerous underlying tasks in ML for CL (and NLP) applications, we will discuss deep learning approaches. We will work with neural network models applied to traditional CL and NLP problems.

Among others, we will cover word vector representations, window-based neural networks, recurrent neural networks, long-short-term-memory models, recursive neural networks, convolutional neural networks, etc.

The course is a series of lectures and hands-on programming exercises.

The course is using material provided by:

- Stanford University: [CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)
- The [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) textbook (MIT Press) by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville
- Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin. [Speech and Language Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) (3rd ed. draft)

These courses are accompanied by videos, slides, research papers, links to supplemental material and tutorials, and other very valuable information. Please use these resources during our course.

# Policies

## Academic Integrity

(from the Dean for Academic Standards and Opportunities) As a student at IU, you are expected to adhere to the standards and policies detailed in the Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct ([*http://www.iu.edu/~code/*](http://www.iu.edu/%7Ecode/)). When you submit an assignment with your name on it, you are signifying that the work contained therein is all yours, unless otherwise cited or referenced. Any ideas or materials taken from another source for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged. If you are unsure about the expectations for completing an assignment or taking a test or exam, be sure to seek clarification beforehand. All suspected violations of the Code will be handled according to University policies. Sanctions for academic misconduct may include a failing grade on the assignment, reduction in your final course grade, a failing grade in the course, among other possibilities, and must include a report to the Dean of Students who may impose additional disciplinary sanctions.


## Students with Disabilities

Students who need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact me to arrange an appointment as soon as possible to discuss the course format, to anticipate needs, and to explore potential accommodations.

I rely on Disability Services for Students for assistance in verifying the need for accommodations and developing accommodation strategies. Students who have not previously contacted Disability Services are encouraged to do so (812-855-7578; [*http://www.indiana.edu/~iubdss/*](http://www.indiana.edu/%7Eiubdss/)).


## CAPS

One benefit of a school like IU is that there are many, many resources available to you. School and life can be intense at times, and if your academic responsibilities or other personal concerns are distracting or weighing on you this semester, I encourage you to contact Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) (812) 855-5711, http://healthcenter.indiana.edu/counseling/). The people there can be a resource and a source of support, not just in times of crisis, but also when you need an extra ear or a little extra support. I’m happy to be a listening ear, as well, but I have no counseling training and the folks at CAPS do. Note, too, that I am required to report certain things (e.g., reports of sexual assault, suicidal thoughts).


## Note Selling

Several commercial services have approached students regarding selling class notes/study guides to their classmates. Selling the instructor’s notes/study guides in this course is not permitted. Violations of this policy will be reported to the Dean of Students as academic misconduct (violation of course rules). Sanctions for academic misconduct may include a failing grade on the assignment for which the notes/study guides are being sold, a reduction in your final course grade, a failing grade in the course, among other possibilities. Additionally, you should know that selling a faculty member’s notes/study guides individually or on behalf of one of these services using IU email, or via Canvas may also constitute a violation of IU information technology and IU intellectual property policies and additional consequences may result.


## Sexual Misconduct Policies at IU

As your instructor, one of my responsibilities is to create a positive learning environment for all students. Title IX and IU’s Sexual Misconduct Policy prohibit sexual misconduct in any form, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, stalking, and dating and domestic violence.  If you have experienced sexual misconduct, or know someone who has, the University can help. If you are seeking help and would like to speak to someone confidentially, you can make an appointment with:

- The Sexual Assault Crisis Services (SACS) at (812) 855-8900 (counseling services)
- Confidential Victim Advocates (CVA) at (812) 856-2469 (advocacy and advice services)
- IU Health Center at (812) 855-4011 (health and medical services)

It is also important that you know that Title IX and University policy require me to share any information brought to my attention about potential sexual misconduct, with the campus Deputy Title IX Coordinator or IU’s Title IX Coordinator.  In that event, those individuals will work to ensure that appropriate measures are taken and resources are made available.   Protecting student privacy is of utmost concern, and information will only be shared with those that need to know to ensure the University can respond and assist.

I encourage you to visit stopsexualviolence.iu.edu to learn more.
