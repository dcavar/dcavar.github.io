I developed a few [iHaskell](https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell) notebooks (see [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
or [Kronos Haskell for Mac](http://www.kronosnotebook.com/haskell)) as tutorials and material accompanying different
courses in Computational Linguistics (CL), Natural Language Processing (NLP), AI and Machine Learning (ML).
The material will eventually be all listed here and made available for download:

- Intro to Haskell (zip, jupyter notebook)
- ...
