I published a new version of [ELAN2split] on Bitbucket.

[ELAN2split] is a tool that creates pairs of audio/transcription files that correspond to time-aligned segments in
an [ELAN] file. Each time-aligned segment is saved in two files, the trimmed WAVE-file from the original recording
and the transcription or annotation text in the corresponding tier that can be selected via command line.
This corpus is ideal to build and train a Forced Aligner and initial speech corpora and subsequently to train
a speech recognizer. I built this tool to work with the [Prosodylab-Aligner].

This is a command line tool. It does not come with a graphical interface. Binary versions for
[Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit](https://bitbucket.org/dcavar/elan2split/downloads/Ubuntu-16.04-64bit-elan2split.zip) and
[Mac OSX](https://bitbucket.org/dcavar/elan2split/downloads/MacOSX_elan2split.zip) are available in the
[Downloads](https://bitbucket.org/dcavar/elan2split/downloads) section of the Bitbucket repository.
