## Communicating with Amazon Alexa via HTTPS using a Curtom Skill programmed in Go

You can use Go to set up a server that communicates to Amazon Alexa via HTTPS and your personal NLU or NLP pipeline. See for an example the GitHub repo at:

[https://github.com/dcavar/alexa_https](https://github.com/dcavar/alexa_https)

This is using HTTPS to communicate with the Amazon server, XML-RPC (over HTTP) to communicate with local NLP components, and JSON parsing into Go-struct data structures.

"Go Alexa!"

Have fun!
