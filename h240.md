**Course Description**

Science permeates society, but the reverse is also true. The agendas of scientists, ethical norms in
science, and the goals of scientific endeavors all have societal underpinnings. This course considers how
science affects societal forms and functions and how society affects the scientific enterprise.

Addressing state-of-the-art technologies in Artificial Intelligence, Linguistic and Natural Language
Processing capabilities of advanced Large Language Models, and the perspectives of Machines
becoming intelligent. This course addresses not just the technologies and applications of AI and possible
Artificial General Intelligence but also aspects of human cognition and intelligence from a psycholinguistic
perspective, as well as philosophical and sociological issues, risks, and improvements for society and
human life.
