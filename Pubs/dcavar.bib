abstract = {Vector representations as embeddings of words, text, or images in n-dimensional semantic space are essential for neural models in state-of-the-art (SOTA) Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI systems. Such embedding models are engineered and trained using classical computers and large amounts of data. Given the current technical limitations, we are unaware of a method to achieve the same task on a quantum computer alone. In this report, we discuss experimental results related to hybrid systems utilizing classical models in quantum algorithms for common NLP and AI inferencing. We demonstrate how word and text embeddings as n-dimensional dense vectors of real numbers, as used in current classical SOTA AI systems, can be mapped to quantum states using and qubits. The quantum encoding strategies used for this task include amplitude encoding of real and complex word embeddings to quantum state vectors, as well as reductions of Hamiltonian representations of quantum states to further reduce the number of required qubits, the number of gates, and the circuit depth. We show that the mapping results in a linear number of circuit gates. The high correlation coefficient between the classical and quantum embedding similarity scores indicates that there is no significant information loss that would affect the semantic space distribution of words in the tested quantum encoding strategies. The results show that existing NLP embedding models in classical computing environments can be used efficiently in quantum computing. We discuss how improvements of classical embedding models could significantly improve the classical to quantum computing interface for popular systems, such as Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLM).}

abstract = {This paper introduces the Hoosiers Arabic Ellipsis Corpus, a novel dataset targeting syntactic ellipsis in Arabic. Addressing the significant challenge ellipsis poses to natural language processing (NLP) technologies, the Hoosiers Arabic Ellipsis Corpus leverages the Corpus Query Language (CQL) to extract ellipsis instances from the ArTenTen corpus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive dataset of its kind, filling a critical gap in resources for Arabic, which remains under-resourced in NLP studies. We evaluate the corpus through three computational experiments: detecting sentences with ellipsis, predicting the location of elided elements, and generating missing words using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Results demonstrate that few-shot prompting significantly improves LLM performance, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the highest accuracy in ellipsis detection (95.6%). However, LLMs struggled with precisely locating and reconstructing elided elements. The findings highlight the challenges of ellipsis processing in Arabic and point to the need for larger, more balanced datasets and further refinement of NLP models to handle structural inference.},

In this paper, we present AMWAL, a named entity recognition system for Arabic financial news. Our approach centered on building a specialized corpus compiled from three major Arabic financial newspapers spanning from 2000 to 2023. Entities were extracted from this corpus using a semi-automatic process that included manual annotation and review to ensure accuracy. The total number of entities identified amounts to 17.1k tokens, distributed across 20 categories, providing a comprehensive coverage of financial entities. To standardize the identified entities, we adopt financial concepts from the Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO, 2020), aligning our framework with industry standards. The significance of our work lies not only in the creation of the first customized NER system for Arabic financial data but also in its potential to streamline information extraction processes in the financial domain. Our NER system achieves a Precision score of 96.08, a Recall score of 95.87, and an F1 score of 95.97, which outperforms state-of-the-art general Arabic NER systems as well as other systems for financial NER in other languages."

TIE-ML facilitates rapid annotation of essential tense features at the clause level by labeling simple or periphrastic tense properties, as well as scope relations between clauses, and temporal interpretation at the sentence level. This paper presents the first annotation samples and empirical results. The application of the TIE-ML strategy on the sentences in the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) and other non-English language data is discussed in detail. The motivation, insights, and future directions for TIE-ML are discussed, too. The aim is to develop a more efficient annotation strategy and a formalism for clause-level tense and aspect labeling, event sequencing, and tense scope relations that boosts the productivity of tense and event-level corpus annotation. The central goal is to facilitate the production of large data sets for machine learning and quantitative linguistic studies of intra- and cross-linguistic semantic properties of temporal and event logic."

    abstract = "This project approaches the problem of language documentation and revitalization from a rather untraditional angle. To improve and facilitate language documentation of endangered languages, we attempt to use corpus linguistic methods and speech and language technologies to reduce the time needed for transcription and annotation of audio and video language recordings. The paper demonstrates this approach on the example of the endangered and seriously under-resourced variety of Eastern Chatino (CTP). We show how initial speech corpora can be created that can facilitate the development of speech and language technologies for under-resourced languages by utilizing Forced Alignment tools to time align transcriptions. Time-aligned transcriptions can be used to train speech corpora and utilize automatic speech recognition tools for the transcription and annotation of untranscribed data. Speech technologies can be used to reduce the time and effort necessary for transcription and annotation of large collections of audio and video recordings in digital language archives, addressing the transcription bottleneck problem that most language archives and many under-documented languages are confronted with. This approach can increase the availability of language resources from low-resourced and endangered languages to speech and language technology research and development."

    abstract = "TIE-ML (Temporal Information Event Markup Language) first proposed by Cavar et al. (2021) provides a radically simplified temporal annotation schema for event sequencing and clause level temporal properties even in complex sentences. TIE-ML facilitates rapid annotation of essential tense features at the clause level by labeling simple or periphrastic tense properties, as well as scope relations between clauses, and temporal interpretation at the sentence level. This paper presents the first annotation samples and empirical results. The application of the TIE-ML strategy on the sentences in the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) and other non-English language data is discussed in detail. The motivation, insights, and future directions for TIE-ML are discussed, too. The aim is to develop a more efficient annotation strategy and a formalism for clause-level tense and aspect labeling, event sequencing, and tense scope relations that boosts the productivity of tense and event-level corpus annotation. The central goal is to facilitate the production of large data sets for machine learning and quantitative linguistic studies of intra- and cross-linguistic semantic properties of temporal and event logic.",

Although theoretically well-documented and understood, there needs to be more sufficient cross-linguistic language resources to document, study, and ultimately engineer NLP solutions that can adequately provide analyses for ellipsis constructions. This article describes the typological data set on ellipsis that we created for currently seventeen languages. We demonstrate how SotA parsers based on a variety of syntactic frameworks fail to parse sentences with ellipsis, and in fact, probabilistic, neural, and Large Language Models (LLM) do so, too. We demonstrate experiments that focus on detecting sentences with ellipsis, predicting the position of elided elements, and predicting elided surface forms in the appropriate positions. We show that cross-linguistic variation of ellipsis-related phenomena has different consequences for the architecture of NLP systems.",
