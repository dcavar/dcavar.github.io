## Java JNI to C++ Wrapper for Foma

I just published the code for a new [Java JNI wrapper](https://github.com/dcavar/fomaJNI) for a C++ class that links to [Foma](https://fomafst.github.io) on GitHub. This makes using [Foma](https://fomafst.github.io) (or [XFST](http://www.fsmbook.com/)) based Finite State Transducers much easier, from both, C++ and Java. This is part of my Free Linguistic Environment project to develop a free and open alternative of an LFG-parser, but it can be used in various kinds of NLP applications.

See for more details:
