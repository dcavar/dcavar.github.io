## Tutorial

If you are interested in some meetings and tutorials on Lisp and Prolog for computational semantics, pragmatics, reasoning, probabilistic logic, let me know. During Spring 2020 I will organize some sessions here at Indiana University at Bloomington to go over some publications, tutorials, and work through some code.

Date and Time: Spring 2020

Location: IU Bloomington Campus, TBA

## Topics

We will look into Prolog and Common Lisp again, using these tools:

- [SWI Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/)
- [Allegro Common Lisp](https://franz.com/products/allegro-common-lisp/) (Express) (which also includes a Lisp-based Prolog module)
- [Steel Bank Common Lisp](http://www.sbcl.org/)
- [DrRacket](https://racket-lang.org/) (for some Scheme-based experiments), but our focus would be on Common Lisp and Prolog

See for some documentation the links on the corresponding websites.

We use a Slack channel to communicate meeting times and other arrangements. Email me to add you to the Slack channel.

See the two GitHub repos for material related to these meetings:

- [Prolog repo](https://github.com/dcavar/prolog-tutorial)
- [Common Lisp repo](https://github.com/dcavar/common_lisp_tutorial)
