<h3>Haskell</h3>
<p>I developed a few <a href="https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell">iHaskell</a> notebooks (see <a
        href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> or <a href="http://www.kronosnotebook.com/haskell">Kronos Haskell for
    Mac</a>)
    as tutorials and material accompanying different courses in
    Computational Linguistics (CL), Natural Language Processing (NLP), AI
    and Machine Learning (ML). The material will eventually be all listed
    here and made available for download:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Intro to Haskell (zip, jupyter notebook)</li>
    <li>…</li>
</ul>
