## Research

See the activities in my [Natural Processing Lab](http://nlp-lab.org/) for more details.


**Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP)**

The main focus of my Q-NLP work is related to Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and AI using Quantum Computing.

See:

- [Quantum NLP](https://nlp-lab.org/quantumnlp/)


**Knowledge Graph Extraction and Natural Language Processing:**

- [Large Language Models, NLP, and Ellipsis and Empty Element Parsing](https://nlp-lab.org/ellipsis)
- [Large Language Models, NLP, and Discontinuity and Non-local Dependency Processing in Natural Language Discourse](https://nlp-lab.org/discontinuities)
- [TIE-ML](https://nlp-lab.org/timeevents/) - [Temporal Information and Event Annotation](https://nlp-lab.org/timeevents/) ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/dcavar/tieml))

- Knowledge Graphs from unstructured data and common sense reasoning, Temporal Graph Neural Networks<br/>
	[Computaional Semantics and Pragmatics](https://nlp-lab.org/discontinuities/CompSemGraph)


**Competitions and Challenges:**

- Second Phase of the [US Navy AINet ANTX AI Prize Challenge](https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/networks-advanced-naval-technology-exercise-ainetantx-artificial-intelligence-prize-challenge/) with postdoc Anthony Meyer and CL student Billy Dickson
