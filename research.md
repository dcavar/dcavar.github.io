## Research

See the activities in the [Natural Processing Lab](http://nlp-lab.org/) for more details.

**Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP)**

See:

- [Quantum NLP](https://nlp-lab.org/quantumnlp/)


**Knowledge Graph Extraction and Natural Language Processing:**

- [Large Language Models, NLP, and Ellipsis and Empty Element Parsing](https://nlp-lab.org/ellipsis)
- [Large Language Models, NLP, and Discontinuity and Non-local Dependency Processing in Natural Language Discourse](https://nlp-lab.org/discontinuities)
- [TIE-ML](https://nlp-lab.org/timeevents/) - [Temporal Information and Event Annotation](https://nlp-lab.org/timeevents/) ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/dcavar/tieml))

- Knowledge Graphs from unstructured data and common sense reasoning, Temporal Graph Neural Networks


**Competitions and Challenges:**

- Second Phase of the [US Navy AINet ANTX AI Prize Challenge](https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/networks-advanced-naval-technology-exercise-ainetantx-artificial-intelligence-prize-challenge/) with postdoc Anthony Meyer and CL student Billy Dickson


In general, in addition to Graph models of knowledge from language, I am strongly interested in Quantum NLP:
