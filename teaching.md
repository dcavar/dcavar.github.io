## Teaching

**Spring 2024**

- **LING-L 614** (3 credits) *Alternative Syntactic Theories* (Course Description: Examining syntactic frameworks as for example LFG, HPSG, Construction Grammar, Categorial Grammar, Dependency Grammar, among others; providing specific analyses and application of syntactic phenomena in terms of specific issues of syntactic analysis and general claims about the nature of the organization of the syntax of natural languages. Emphasis on developing analyses within the selected framework.)

- **[LING-L 665](/l665)** (3 credits) *Applying Machine Learning Techniques in Computational Linguistics* / CSCI-B 659 *Topics in Artificial Intelligence* (Course Description: Introduction to major algorithms in Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) as well as applications of these techniques to a wide range of NLP/CL topics. The course includes an advanced introduction to NLP/CL and is focused on advanced NLP algorithms including Deep Learning and Large Language Models. Also considered are applications of ML algorithms to NLP/CL problems.)

- **[HON-H 240](/h240/)** ([Hutton Honors College](https://hutton.indiana.edu/index.html)) *[Language, Intelligence, and the Machine](/h240/)* (Course Description: Addressing state-of-the-art technologies in Artificial Intelligence, Linguistic and Natural Language Processing capabilities of advanced Large Language Models, and the perspectives of Machines becoming intelligent. This course addresses not just the technologies and applications of AI and possible Artificial General Intelligence but also aspects of human cognition and intelligence from a psycholinguistic perspective, as well as philosophical and sociological issues, risks, and improvements for society and human life.)
